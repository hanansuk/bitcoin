## Is Bitcoin the New Internal Combustion Engine?
### Research Proposal
### Hanan Sukenik, Jeremiah Stone, Kevin Xuan, Michael Saffell
------------------------------


- The goal of this analysis is to determine the impact that Bitcoin has had on Teslaâ€™s
corporate GHG footprint. The output of this analysis can serve as a case study / produce
a framework for assessing the GHG impact of Bitcoin investments or impact of Bitcoin
adoption as a payment currency for other products, which will be useful for entities
considering eco-conscious investments or brand positioning.

- Through this project, we will:
    * Over view the topic and the research question
    * Describe the data and datasets needed for the project
    * Design a study to explore our research question
    * Describe the sampling process, statistical methods, potential risks, deliverables and timeline
    
  
- The project includes a single file containing the final report ("W201_Research_Design_Final_Project-_Stone_Xuan_Saffell_Sukenik.pdf")

Enjoy!
